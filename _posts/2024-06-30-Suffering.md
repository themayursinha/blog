## Why do we suffer? A look at injustice without a God

Why is there so much unfairness, cruelty, and pain in the world? This is one of the deepest and most difficult questions we can ask. It gets even tougher if you don't believe in a god or an afterlife where things might be made right.

In this post, we'll look at how different thinkers have tried to answer this question from a secular viewpoint—one that doesn’t rely on religion. We'll explore reasons that come from science, philosophy, and the way our societies are built.

### It's just nature

From a scientific view, a lot of suffering is just a part of the natural world. Things like diseases, natural disasters, and even our own biology play a big role. By understanding these natural causes, we can start to see where pain comes from without needing a supernatural explanation.

- **Natural Events:** Sicknesses, like the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), and natural disasters, like earthquakes and hurricanes, cause incredible pain. These events are not good or evil; they are just the planet working as it does. They happen because of biology, geology, and weather, and they don't care about our ideas of fairness.
    
- **Human Nature:** Our own actions can lead to cruelty and injustice, and this is often tied to our biology and psychology. For example, traits like aggression or selfishness might have helped our ancestors survive. In today's world, however, those same traits can lead to terrible outcomes. Our minds are also a factor. Mental health issues and past trauma can deeply affect how people behave.
    

This view doesn't look for a grand, cosmic reason for suffering. Instead, it suggests we can fight it with science, medicine, better disaster planning, and good mental healthcare.

### The world doesn't care (And why that's okay)

Existentialist thinkers like [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre) and [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) had a radical idea: the universe is simply indifferent to us. [Existentialism](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/existentialism) teaches that because the world doesn't have a built-in meaning, we have to create our own. It sees cruelty and injustice as part of life's "absurdity"—a weird, meaningless reality we have to face.

Camus wrote about the concept of the **[absurd](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/)**. This is the clash between our human need to find meaning and the silent, meaningless universe we live in. But for Camus, realizing this isn't a reason to give up. Instead, it can make us feel truly free. If there are no cosmic rules, then we are responsible for creating our own values.

In a world that doesn't care, it's up to us to act with kindness and build communities that value justice. This philosophy encourages us to get involved and actively try to make life better for everyone.

### It's the system's fault

Many thinkers argue that the true source of much injustice is found in our social and economic systems. When a society is built on inequality and unfair power, suffering is the result. Philosophers like [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) and many modern critics say that to reduce injustice, we have to change the systems we live in.

- **Economic Unfairness:** [Economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality) is a huge source of suffering. When a few people have most of the money and resources, many others are left without good schools, healthcare, or opportunities. This traps people in poverty and pushes them to the sidelines of society. To fix this, we need big changes like fairer taxes and strong social safety nets.
    
- **Broken Institutions:** Corrupt governments, unfair laws, and broken legal systems also create immense suffering. To fight this, we need reforms that make our institutions honest, open, and fair. Giving power to marginalized groups and protecting democracy are key steps toward fixing this.
    

### Our animal instincts

[Evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology) offers another angle. It suggests that some of our worst behaviors, like aggression and selfishness, might exist because they once helped our ancestors survive in a very different world.

For instance, aggression was useful when competing for food and safety. On the other hand, kindness also evolved. Helping our family ([kin selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection)) or helping someone who might help us later ([reciprocal altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism)) were good survival strategies.

The problem is that these ancient instincts don't always work well in our modern world. Aggression can lead to violence, and extreme selfishness can tear a community apart. By understanding where these impulses come from, we can create better ways to manage them, like teaching empathy and cooperation.

### It's up to us

[Humanism](https://humanists.international/what-is-humanism/) is a philosophy that puts its faith in people. Humanists believe that since this is the only life we have, it's our job to make it as good as possible. The responsibility for fixing injustice and reducing suffering belongs to us, and we can do it using empathy, reason, and teamwork.

Humanism stresses that by understanding how others feel (empathy) and using logic and compassion to guide our actions, we can build a better world. It pushes for social reforms, better education, and community action to create fairer, kinder societies for everyone.

### How we can make a difference

Even without a cosmic plan, we are not helpless. We have the power to reduce injustice and suffering in the world. Here are a few clear ways to do it:

1. **Support Science and Medicine:** Investing in research helps us fight diseases and prepare for natural disasters, directly reducing a major source of human pain.
    
2. **Fix Unfair Systems:** Push for changes that address economic inequality. This includes things like fair wages, social safety nets, and equal access to good schools and healthcare. Demand that our public institutions be transparent and accountable.
    
3. **Promote Empathy and Education:** Support education that teaches critical thinking, ethics, and human rights. When we understand each other better, we are more likely to act with compassion.
    
4. **Get Involved:** Real change often comes from the ground up. Join community groups, support advocacy organizations, or participate in movements that are working to fix specific injustices.
    
5. **Create Your Own Meaning:** As the existentialists suggest, find purpose by taking responsibility. Live by a strong personal code of ethics and work with others to build a just and compassionate community around you.
    

In the end, while the world may not be naturally fair, we have the ability to make it fairer. By working together, we can tackle the great challenges of injustice, cruelty, and suffering.
