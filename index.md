Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I work in Cybersecurity, and it has taught me not to take things for granted. It has made me more curious about the world. I break software and hardware for pleasure & money. Beyond work, my interest touches on a wide range of topics, including Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Astronomy, Aeronautics, Electronics, Philosophy, Psychology, Consciousness, Religion, Politics. I'm an avid reader, and I constantly look for like-minded folks with whom I can share and discuss my ideas about the world. 

You can take a look at my projects. Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss & share ideas.
