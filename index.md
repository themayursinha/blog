Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I work in technology, and it has made me more curious about the world. Although, I build & break software and hardware for pleasure & money but beyond work, my interest touches on a wide range of topics, including Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Astronomy, Aeronautics, Electronics, Philosophy, Psychology, Consciousness, Religion, Politics. I'm an avid reader, and I constantly look for like-minded folks with whom I can share and discuss my ideas about the world. You can connect with my on various social-media platforms.

You can take a look at my projects and feel free to contact me if you want to discuss & share ideas.
