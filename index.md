I'm a technologist who is trying to understand the universe and the meaning of life. I enjoy learning about a wide range of topics, from physics and artificial intelligence to why we think and act the way we do.

I love reading and having deep conversations with other curious people. My main goal is to learn the truth about our world by exploring both science and spirituality.

By day, I'm a software engineer focused on security. By night, I work with a non-profit organization that researches how to keep us safe from potential AI threats. I hope for a future where humans and AI can exist together safely and ethically.

I believe humanity is on a path to becoming a cybernetic species, a transformation in which AI will be a critical component. I intend to be an active participant in what may be the most significant evolutionary leap for Homo sapiens.

I'm always happy to connect with people who have similar interests. Let's learn from each other and explore all that life has to offer.

Feel free to reach out and share your thoughts. Together, we can learn new things and discover more about our world.
